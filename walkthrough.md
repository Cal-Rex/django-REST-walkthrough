## Setting up project with Django & Cloudinary on Github
##### https://youtu.be/9BuhX2Tskbk

this section covers:
- registering with cloudinary
- Setting up a django project
- configuring new project to use Cloudinary

1. create a new repo on [github](www.github.com)
- or, use the Codeinstitute full template: [https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template)
2. install Django via the CLI
    - `pip3 install django`
    - for this walkthrough, the LTS (Long Term Support) version of cjango was used. to use this, use:
        - `pip3 install 'django<4'`
3. Start a new project in the repo with django called `drf_api`, using the following command:
    - `django-admin startproject drf_api .`
        - the `.` initializes the project in the current directory
4. next, install cloudinary into the project with the following command:
    - `pip install django-cloudinary-storage`
5. install `Pillow`.
    - this library adds image processing capabilities that we need for this project. Note that it’s name starts with a capital P.
    - `pip install Pillow`
6. import the newly installed cloudinary apps (`cloudinary_storage` and `cloudinary`) into `settings.py` > `INSTALLED_APPS[]`
    - be sure to place `cloudinary_storage` **BEFORE** `django.contrib.staticfiles`
    - add `cloudinary` to the bottom of the `INSTALLED_APPS` list.
    - example of what `INSTALLED_APPS` should look like:
        ```py
        INSTALLED_APPS = [
            'django.contrib.admin',
            'django.contrib.auth',
            'django.contrib.contenttypes',
            'django.contrib.sessions',
            'django.contrib.messages',
            'cloudinary_storage',
            'django.contrib.staticfiles',
            'cloudinary'
        ]
        ```
7. set up `env.py` and the cloudinary environment variable
    - create a new `env.py` file
    - make sure it is included in `.gitignore`
    - add `import os` to the top of the file
    - set an environ for cloudinary using the cloudinary API key found on your cloudinary account page
        `os.environ['CLOUDINARY_URL'] = 'cloudinary://[REMOVE_THIS_AND_ADD_YOUR_API_KEY]@[REMOVE_THIS_AND_ADD_YOUR_CLOUD_NAME]'`
    - make an offline copy of your `env.py` file, incase you have to make a fresh workspace
8. next, set up a conditional in `settings.py` that if `env.py` exists, import it into settings.py
    - place this directly below `from pathlib import Path` at the tp of the file
    -   ```py
        import os

        if os.path.exists('env.py'):
            import env
        ```
9. beneath that code, retreive the cloudinary environment as an object inside a variable called `CLOUDINARY_STORAGE`:
    - `CLOUDINARY_STORAGE = {'CLOUDINARY_URL': os.environ.get('CLOUDINARY_URL')}`
10. then, beneath that, define a setting for where media files will be stored:
    - `MEDIA_URL = '/media/'`
11. lastly, beneath that, add a default file storage setting:
    - `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'`

top of `setting.py` should now look like this:
```py
from pathlib import Path
import os

if os.path.exists('env.py'):
    import env

CLOUDINARY_STORAGE = {'CLOUDINARY_URL': os.environ.get('CLOUDINARY_URL')}
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'

# Build paths inside the project like this: BASE_DIR / 'subdir'.
BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent


# Quick-start development settings - unsuitable for production
# See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/howto/deployment/checklist/

# SECURITY WARNING: keep the secret key used in production secret!
SECRET_KEY = 'SECRET_KEY_REMOVED_LOL'

# SECURITY WARNING: don't run with debug turned on in production!
DEBUG = True

ALLOWED_HOSTS = []


# Application definition

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'cloudinary_storage',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'cloudinary'
]
```

## Adding a Profiles app
##### https://youtu.be/kic4oI2f1pM

this section covers:
- creating the profiles app
- writing the profiles model
- using a signal method to create a profile
- [Django signals explained](#django-signals)
- [cheatsheet from CodeInstitute](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i4ZZcV5B9g-a0gXZoxgmt7mhrqdizVOjXuT3-NGxiHg/edit)

1. create the new app with the `startapp` command:
    - `python3 manage.py startapp profiles`
        - (`python3 manage.py startapp YOUR_APP_NAME_HERE`)
2. with the new app created, it also needs to be included in `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:
    -   ```py
        INSTALLED_APPS = [
            'django.contrib.admin',
            'django.contrib.auth',
            'django.contrib.contenttypes',
            'django.contrib.sessions',
            'django.contrib.messages',
            'cloudinary_storage',
            'django.contrib.staticfiles',
            'cloudinary',
            'profiles'
        ]
        ```
3. now, in the newly created `models.py` inside `profiles.py` add a new import at the top of the file:
    - `from django.contrib.auth.models import User`
4. next, inside `models.py` create the first new database model:
    -   ```py
        class Profile(models.Model):
            owner = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
            created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
            updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
            name = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True)
            content = models.TextField(blank=True)
            image = models.ImageField(
                upload_to='images/' default='../samples/landscapes/girl-urban-view'
            )

            class Meta:
                ordering = ['-created_at']
            
            def __str__(self):
                return f"{self.owner}'s profile"
        ```

##### django signals

- event notifications
    > You can think of signals as notifications that  get triggered by an event.
- can listen to the events and run a piece of code every time
    > We can listen for such Model events and have some code, usually a function, run each time that signal is received.
- we'd like to create a user profile every time a user is created
    > In our case, we would want to be notified when a user is created so that a profile can automatically be created alongside it. 
- built-in model signals:
    - pre save
    - post save
    - pre delete
    - post delete

to implement:
1. import the `post_save` signal from `django.db.models.signals` at the top of `models.py`
    - `from django.db.models.signals import post_save`
2. now, beneath the `Profile` class model, add a call to `post_save`appended with the `.connect()` function, passing 2 arguments:
    - the first argument will be `create_profile`, which is the function that needs to be run every time a post is saved. 
    - the second is going to be specifiying who/what is the sender of the new data, in this case, it will be the `User` 
    - `post_save.connect(create_profile, sender=User)`
3. now, above this call, define the `create_profile` function:
    - the function has to take 4 arguments: `(sender, intance, created, **kwargs)`
    - set a conditional statement that if a profile is created, the owner of the profile should be that `User`
    - the function should look like this:
    -   ```py
        def create_profile(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
                    # Because we are passing this function 
                    # to the post_save.connect method
                    # it requires the following arguments:
                    # 1. the sender model,
                    # 2. its instance
                    # 3. created  - which is a boolean value of 
                    #    whether or not the instance has just been created
                    # 4. and kwargs.  
                    if created:
                        # if created is True, we’ll create a profile  
                        # whose owner is going to be that user.
                        Profile.objects.create(owner=instance)
                
        # not part of the function, but this would be sitting
        # directly under it
        post_save.connect(create_profile, sender=User)
        ```
        > now every time a user is created, a signal will trigger the Profile model to be created.
4. register the `Profile` model in `admin.py` so that it will show up in the admin panel
    - `admin.site.register(Profile)`
5. before going any further, migrate the new model into the database in the CLI:
    - `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
    - `python3 manage.py migrate`
6. now, to view the model on the admin panel:
    - first create a superuser/admin
        - `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
        - create a username and password from the command prompts
        - no need to supply an email address
7. run the server and go to admin and see if everything is working:
    - `python3 manage.py runserver`
    - append `/admin` to the url in the browser window and login with the admin credentials
    - be sure to add the workspcae url as an `ALLOWED_HOST` in `settings.py`

> Now, if we run our server, and go to /admin, we see that our first user was created. And their corresponding profile was created with a working image, well done!

8. finally, create a file containing the new project's dependencies via the CLI
    - `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
9. push the changes to github

## REST Framework Serializers
##### https://youtu.be/V7KNSGrSLPg

- how to write a class view to list all profiles
    - how to write a ProfileList
    - how to write an APIView
- Learn what Serializers are and why they're useful
    - what the similarities are between ModelForms and ModelSerializers
- how to write a profile model serializer

How Model Serializers work:
- similar to Django's `ModelForms`, they handle validation
- Uses similar syntax to `ModelForms`:
    - can use `Meta` class
    - can specify extra fields.
    - can use `.is_valid()` and `.save()` methods
    - Handle all the conversions between different data types

> we need a serializer to convert Django model instances to JSON. As we’ll only be working with Django Models, we’ll use model serializers to avoid data replication, just like you would use ModelForm over a regular Form. Before we write a model serializer, let’s talk a bit more about what they are: they are very similar to Django’s ModelForms, in that, they handle validation. The syntax for writing a model serializer is the same, we specify the model and fields in the  Meta class and we can specify extra fields too. We can use methods like .is_valid  and .save with serializers Additionally, they handle all the conversions between different data types.



1.  install `djangorestframework` in the CLI
    - `pip3 install djangorestframework`
    - add it to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py` below `cloudinary`, but above any manually created apps like `Profiles`
        - `'rest_framework',`
        -   ```py
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                'django.contrib.admin',
                'django.contrib.auth',
                'django.contrib.contenttypes',
                'django.contrib.sessions',
                'django.contrib.messages',
                'cloudinary_storage',
                'django.contrib.staticfiles',
                'cloudinary',
                'rest_framework',
                
                'profiles'
            ]
            ```
2. create the first view in `views.py`, start by importing everything needed
    - import `APIView` from `rest_framework.views` at the top of `views.py`
        - `from rest_framework.views import APIView`
    -    > APIView is very similar to Django’s View  class. It also provides a few bits of extra functionality such as making sure you receive Request instances in your view, handling parsing errors, and adding context to Response objects.
    - import `Response` from `rest_framework.response`
        - `from rest_framework.response import Response`
    -    > Even though we could use Django’s HttpResponse, the Response class is specifically built for the  rest framework, and provides a nicer interface for returning content-negotiated Web API responses  that can be rendered to multiple formats.
    - import the `Profile` database model from `models.py`
         - `from .models import Profile`
3. next, use the imported `APIView` view to create a class view called `ProfileList`
    - inside it, define a get request that puts all objects in the `Profiles` table into a variable called `profiles`
    - then, in the return statement, return a `Response` with the parameter of the `profiles` variable 
    -   ```py
        class ProfileList(APIView):
            def get(self, request):
                profiles = Profile.objects.all()
                return Response(profiles)
        ```
4. map the new view to a URL in `urls.py` in the `profiles` app
    - first, import `path` from `django.urls`
    - import the `profiles` argument established in the `return Response` from `views.py`
        -   ```py
            from django.urls import path
            from profiles import views
            ```
    - next, create the `urlpatterns` list variable, and write a path for `profiles/` that renders the `ProfileList` view as a view (`as_view()`)
        -   ```py
            urlpatterns = [
                path('profiles/', views.ProfileList.as_view()),
            ]
            ```
5. map the newly made url pattern in `profiles/urls.py` into the urls of `drf_api`
    - at the top of `drf_api/urls.py` add `include` to the imports from `django.urls`
        - `from django.urls import path, include`
    - use the newly imported `include` method to write in a new path for `profiles.urls` in `drf_api/urls.py`'s `urlpatterns`
        -   ```py
            from django.contrib import admin
            from django.urls import path, include

            urlpatterns = [
                path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
                path('', include('profiles.urls')),
            ]
            ```
    > Now, if we start the server, and go to ‘profiles/’, we get an ugly error: Object of type Profile is not JSON serializable. Let's have a look at what’s happening and why we’re seeing this error. 

    > When a user posts data to our API, the following has to happen: we need that data to be deserialized, which means it needs to be converted from a data format like JSON or XML to Python native data types. 

    > Then, we have to make sure the data is valid (just like with Django forms) once it’s validated, a model  instance is saved in the database.

    > If our users are requesting data from our API, a queryset or model instance is returned from the database. It is then converted to Python native data types before the data is sent back, it is converted again, or serialized to a given format (most commonly JSON). 
    
    > This is the reason we saw the error. The profiles can’t be just thrown in as a part of the Response, we need a serializer to convert Django model instances to JSON.  

6. create a new file, `serializers.py` in the `profiles` app.
7. in the new file, import the following:
    - `serializers` from `rest_framework`
    - `Profile` from `.models`
    -    ```py
        from rest_framework import serializers
        from .models import Profile
        ```
8. create a class with the name `ProfileSerializer` that inherits from `serializers.ModelSerializer` and create a `ReadOnlyField` from `serializers` called `owner`, it should contain the parameter `source='owner.user`
    - give it a `Meta` class and specify the following fields to include in the response
        - `model = Profile`
        - `fields = []`
            - the value for fields can be determined in 2 ways:
            - > You could list them  all in an array or set to ‘__all__’ like this, however I prefer to be explicit about which  fields I am including, because I might want to add another field to my Profile model later  on, that I don’t want included in the serializer.
                1. `fields = '__all__'`
                2. `fields = ['id', 'owner', 'created_at', 'updated_at', 'name', 'content', 'image']`
                    - > Please note, that when extending Django's model class using models.models, the id field is created automatically without us having to write it ourselves. If we want it to be included in the response, we have to add it to the serializer's field array.
    -   ```py
        from rest_framework import serializers
        from .models import Profile

        class ProfileSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
            owner = serializers.ReadOnlyField(source='owner.username')

            class Meta:
                model = Profile
                fields = [
                    'id',
                    'owner',
                    'created_at',
                    'updated_at',
                    'name',
                    'content',
                    'image'
                ]
        ```

9. return to `views.py` and import the newly made `ProfileSerializer` class
    - `from .serializers import ProfileSerializer`
10. then, in the `ProfileList` class in `views.py`, add a new instance called `serializer`, which makes a call to the newly imported `ProfileSerializer` class at the top of the file, it should contain 2 arguments:
    1. first should be the `profiles` variable containing `all` the `Profile` `objects`
    2. second, should be `many=True` to specify that multiple profile instances are to be serialized
11. in the return statement of `ProfileList`, update the `response` parameter with the value of `serializer.data`
    -   ```py
        from django.shortcuts import render
        from rest_framework.views import APIView
        from rest_framework.response import Response
        from .models import Profile
        from .serializers import ProfileSerializer

        class ProfileList(APIView):
            def get(self, request):
                profiles = Profile.objects.all()
                serializer = ProfileSerializer(profiles, many=True)
                # this takes the objects in profiles and runs it through the
                # ProfileSerializer defined in serializers.py
                # it takes this data, then takes the `Profile` model as a reference
                # and then renders the specified fields within the passed-in
                # dataset into JSON data
                return Response(serializer.data)
        ```
12. check this is all working by running the preview and appending the preview url with `/profiles/`
    - `python3 manage.py runserver`
    - if running correctly, a django REST page should appear, displaying JSON data objects of all the profiles existing within the app. 
    - > we can see the array being returned in a nice user  interface created by rest framework. If we click on the GET json button, we’ll see plain JSON,  which is exactly what a React application would see. Our serializer has taken the Python data and converted it into JSON, which is ready for the front end content to use! 
    
13. > Before we finish, let’s update our dependencies.
    - update `requirements.txt` in the terminal
        - `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`

|       id | BigAuto |       | id      | BigAuto  |

> To access this field, we use dot notation.

**inside serializers.py, in the `ProfileSerializer` class**
```py
owner = serializers.ReadOnlyField(
    source='owner.username'
)
```
> In this case, the “owner” in “owner.username”  stands for the user instance, so any time we want to access a field we simply use dot notation.  

basically `owner` can act as a direct call to that specific user, and using dot notation from `owner` would be the same as `User.AWAYTOIDENTIFYASPECIFICUSER.WHATEVERFIELD`

Now, lets add a 3rd table for `posts`

|        US|ER       | < - > |       PO|ST           | < - > |      PRO|FILE      |
| -------: | :------ | :---: | ------: | :---------- | :---: | ------: | :------- |
|       id | BigAuto |       |      id | BigAuto     |       | id      | BigAuto  |
| username | Char    | < - > |   owner | Foreign Key | < - > | owner   | OneToOne |
| password | Char    |       |   title | Char        |       | name    | Char     |
|          |         |       | content | Text        |       | content | Text     |
|          |         |       |   image | Image       |       | image   | Image    |

> Let’s assume we are working  on PostSerializer instead of ProfileSerializer like we did in the previous video.

In these tables, `Post.owner` is a `ForeignKey` field, this means if the there was a serializer serializing information from `Post`, the name of a user could be found by dot notation, by going through `owner`(which is targeting the user through it being na instance) then `Profile`, so the dot notation would be `owner.Profile.name`.

```py
class PostSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    profile_image = serializers.ReadOnlyField(
        source='owner.profile.name'
    )
```

> One last challenge. Let’s say we wanted to  add the profile image field to each post.

|        US|ER       | < - > |       PO|ST           | < - > |      PRO|FILE      | subfields |
| -------: | :------ | :---: | ------: | :---------- | :---: | ------: | :------- | :-------: |
|       id | BigAuto |       |      id | BigAuto     |       | id      | BigAuto  |           |
| username | Char    | < - > |   owner | Foreign Key | < - > | owner   | OneToOne |           |
| password | Char    |       |   title | Char        |       | name    | Char     |           |
|          |         |       | content | Text        |       | content | Text     |           |
|          |         |       |   image | Image       |       | image   | Image    | url       |

Because the `profile.image` field comtains a "subfield" housing the `url` for the image, that needs to be targeted directly in the dot notation.

```py
class PostSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    profile_image = serializers.ReadOnlyField(
        source='owner.profile.image.url'
    )
```
